- Level: N/A
- Desc: Jaisa dikhta hai waisa hota hai nahi.

Dekhte hain aap kitne ache se binary ki antar-atma tak pahunch paate ho. Bas dhyaan rahe: kuch cheezein encoded mein chipki hui hain, aur shabd kuch aise hain jo turant samajh nahi aayenge... unless you know where to look

1. Hall of Echos
- Level: Easy
- Description:- In the hall of echoes, eight pillars stand tall, The first whispers ‚Äú16‚Äù as the ancient call. Next, ‚Äú98‚Äù glimmers on the second in line, Then ‚Äú89‚Äù follows, a secret sign. ‚Äú15‚Äù the fourth, then ‚Äú35‚Äù in the lore, ‚Äú75‚Äù echoes next from the old stone door. The last two, ‚Äú17‚Äù and ‚Äú17‚Äù, complete the thrall, Combine them to yield a product, a product of prime. This open testament, known far and wide, Guides many seekers on the cryptic ride.

High above in a celestial dance, Seven stars conceal a code at a glance. Begin with ‚Äú62‚Äù, then ‚Äú78‚Äù appears bright, A ‚Äú04‚Äù then ‚Äú06‚Äù in the shimmering night. Follow with ‚Äú667‚Äù, then ‚Äú94‚Äù in sight, Ending with ‚Äú81‚Äù ‚Äì the exponent of light. Together these values openly impart A dual key‚Äôs face that many may chart.

Yet whispers linger of an unseen art‚Äî A secret mirror that sets the truth apart. For those who dare invert what‚Äôs on display, A hidden key awaits to show the way. Unlock that private cipher, subtle yet prime, And inscribe its secret as your flag in time:
